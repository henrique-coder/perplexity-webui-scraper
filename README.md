### Perplexity Web API Scraper

An unofficial Python client library for interacting with Perplexity AI through its web interface.

This library simulates web browser requests to Perplexity's internal endpoints, allowing programmatic access to its features. It requires an active Perplexity Pro subscription and the user's session token (`__Secure-next-auth.session-token` cookie) for operation.

**Disclaimer:** This project is not affiliated with Perplexity AI. It relies on internal web endpoints that may change without notice, potentially breaking functionality. Use responsibly and at your own risk.
